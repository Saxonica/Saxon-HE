# Saxon-HE 11

The Saxon-HE 11 releases are available in the [Java](Java) folder.

## Release notes for Saxon 11, dated 2023-02-08

Saxon 11.5 is the latest maintenance release on the Saxon 11 branch.
Saxon 11.5 is released in three language versions: SaxonJ
(Java), SaxonCS (.NET 6+), and SaxonC (C/C++, PHP, and Python). For
SaxonJ and SaxonC, there are three editions: (EE, PE, and HE); for
SaxonCS, only the enterprise edition (EE) is available.

*Version numbers (except for private builds) are now two-part numbers:
X.Y where X is the major release and Y is the minor (maintenance)
release.*

* **SaxonCS 11.0** (released 2021-10-05) is the first release in the Saxon 11
series, issued for the .NET 5 platform only. 
* **Saxon 11.1** (released 2022-02-01) provides a maintenance release for
SaxonCS, and a first release for SaxonJ and SaxonC. 
* **Saxon 11.2** (released 2022-02-18) provides a maintenance release for
SaxonJ, SaxonCS, and SaxonC; fixing a number of bugs and usability issues
relative to 11.1.
* **Saxon 11.3** (released 2022-03-28) maintenance release.
* **Saxon 11.4** (released 2022-07-28) provides a maintenance release for
SaxonJ, SaxonCS, and SaxonC; with this release, we are now recommending
Saxon 11 as the most stable and reliable release for production use.
* **Saxon 11.5** (released 2023-02-08) provides a maintenance release for
SaxonJ, SaxonCS, and SaxonC. SaxonCS 11.5 is built for .NET 6.

SaxonCS 11.5 requires .NET Core 6+, while SaxonCS 11.4 and earlier require .NET
Core 5+. Applications running on .NET Framework 4.x should stick with the older
product Saxon/.NET 10.x.

## Resources

The file [saxon-resources-11.zip](resources/saxon-resources-11.zip)
contains documentation, sample files, test drivers and other miscellaneous
resources. It is common to all platforms, and is not normally updated when
new maintenance releases appear.

## Source code

Most users will not need access to source code. For those that do, it
is available in two forms.

(a) The raw source (with latest patches) is in a Git repository at
https://saxonica.plan.io/projects/saxonmirrorhe/repository.

(b) For convenience, a zip file is made available which contains
preprocessed source code that can be loaded directly into an IDE. See the
[source](source) folder; the latest version is
[saxon11-5source.zip](source/saxon11-5source.zip).
