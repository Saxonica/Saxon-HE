## Current releases

This repository contains all releases for the current actively maintained
versions of Saxon-HE: [10](10), [11](11), and [12](12).

The latest production release of Saxon-HE is [12.5](12).

Saxon 12 is currently considered the most stable and reliable release.

You can download any of the current releases from the

## Older releases

Earlier releases of Saxon-HE 10, 11, and 12 are also available from
this repository, but aren’t packaged as releases. To download ZIP
files from GitHub, navigate to the page for the ZIP file. In some browsers,
there’s an obvious “Download” button, on others, you have to
choose
the “Download raw file”
(<img src="https://github.com/Saxonica/Saxon-HE/blob/main/img/download.png"

      />)
link on the right hand side of the page.

An archive of even older releases and projects of perhaps historical
interest is preserved in the
[Saxon-Archive repository](https://github.com/saxonica/Saxon-Archive).
