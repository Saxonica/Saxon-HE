Release notes for Saxon 10, dated 2022-03-15

Saxon 10.8 is the latest maintenance release on the Saxon 10 branch. Version numbers (except for
private builds) are now two-part numbers: X.Y where X is the major release and Y is the minor
(maintenance) release. Saxon 10.7 is released in three editions (EE, PE, and HE), on the Java and
.NET platform only.

The first release in the Saxon 10 series was Saxon 10.0, issued on 2020-03-16. Version 10.8
(released 2022-03-15) fixes a number of bugs and usability issues.

We are currently recommending Saxon 10 as the most stable and reliable release for production use.

The documentation at http://www.saxonica.com/documentation10/ includes a detailed list of changes
for each major release, and also includes installation instructions.

Links to all download files can be found at http://www.saxonica.com/download/download_page.xml

The file saxon-resources-10.zip contains documentation, sample files, test drivers and other
miscellaneous resources. It is common to all platforms, and is not normally updated when new
maintenance releases appear.

Most users will not need access to source code. For those that do, it is available in two forms.

(a) the raw source (with latest patches) is in a Git repository at
https://saxonica.plan.io/projects/saxonmirrorhe/repository.

(b) For convenience, the file saxon10-8source.zip on SourceForge contains preprocessed source code
that can be loaded directly into an IDE.
