# Saxon-HE 12

The Saxon-HE 12 releases are available in the [Java](Java) folder.

## Release notes for Saxon 12, dated 2024-07-02

Saxon 12.5 is latest maintenance release on the Saxon 12 branch.
Saxon 12.5 is released in three language versions: SaxonJ
(Java), SaxonCS (.NET 6+), and SaxonC (C/C++, PHP, and Python). For
SaxonJ and SaxonC, there are three editions: (EE, PE, and HE); for
SaxonCS, only the enterprise edition (EE) is available.

*Version numbers (except for private builds) are now two-part numbers:
X.Y where X is the major release and Y is the minor (maintenance)
release.*

SaxonCS 12 requires .NET Core 6+; applications running on .NET
Framework 4.x should stick with the older product Saxon/.NET 10.x.

The documentation at https://www.saxonica.com/documentation12/ includes a
detailed list of changes for each major release, and also includes
installation instructions.

## Resources

The file [saxon-resources-12.zip](https://github.com/Saxonica/Saxon-HE/releases/download/SaxonHE12-5/saxon-resources-12.zip)
contains documentation, sample files, test drivers and other miscellaneous
resources. It is common to all platforms, and is not normally updated when
new maintenance releases appear.

## Source code

Most users will not need access to source code. For those that do, it
is available in two forms.

(a) The raw source (with latest patches) is in a Git repository at
https://saxonica.plan.io/projects/saxonmirrorhe/repository.

(b) For convenience, a zip file is made available which contains
preprocessed source code that can be loaded directly into an IDE. See
[the release](https://github.com/Saxonica/Saxon-HE/releases/tag/SaxonHE12-5).
